Description:
    This creates Apache AGE nodes that work seamlessly with Rails.
    A node can be created with or without a namespace.
    See the below examples.

Example:
    `bin/rails g apache_age:node Cat name age:integer`

    This creates:
        `app/nodes/cat.rb`

    with the contents:
        ```
        class Cat
          include ApacheAge::Entities::Vertex

          attribute :name, :string
          attribute :age, :integer

          validates :name, presence: true
          validates :age, presence: true

          # unique node validator (remove any attributes that are not important to uniqueness)
          validates_with(
            ApacheAge::Validators::UniqueVertexValidator,
            attributes: [:name, :age]
          )
        end
        ```

    A namespace can also be used:
        `bin/rails g apache_age:node Animals/Cat name age:integer`

    This creates:
        `app/nodes/animals/cat.rb`

    with the contents
        ```
        class Animals::Cat
          include ApacheAge::Entities::Vertex

          attribute :name, :string
          attribute :age, :integer

          validates :name, presence: true
          validates :age, presence: true

          # unique node validator (remove any attributes that are not important to uniqueness)
          validates_with(
            ApacheAge::Validators::UniqueVertexValidator,
            attributes: [:name, :age]
          )
        end
        ```
