# TODO

- [ ] Simplify setup with a `lib/tasks/install.rake` task (Add a `rails_age:install` generator)
- [ ] Enforce Private and Protected methods
- [ ] Implement paths and associated parts (nodes and edges)
- [ ] Figure out / test how to add unique constraints and validations to nodes and edges
- [ ] Figure out how to restrict the node types for edges (important for validation and view display)
- [ ] Add additional data-types to be stored in the age properties (Arrays, Hashes, etc.)
